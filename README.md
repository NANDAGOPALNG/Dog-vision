# Dog Vision

Dog Vision is a deep learning project built using the TensorFlow framework. It aims to classify dog breeds from images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). This project is designed for dog enthusiasts, researchers, and developers who are interested in image classification using deep learning.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Image Classification**: Uses a CNN model to identify different dog breeds.
- **TensorFlow Framework**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for efficient model training and deployment.
- **Pre-trained Models Support**: Supports transfer learning with models like MobileNetV2, ResNet, and InceptionV3.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Option to integrate with a web app or API for easy image uploads and classification.
- **Dataset Support**: Compatible with various open-source dog breed datasets.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

### Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-vision.git
cd dog-vision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
Run the following command to train the model:
```sh
python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset
```

### Evaluating the Model
To test the model's accuracy:
```sh
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model
```

### Running Predictions
For classifying an image:
```sh
python predict.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
```

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available dog breed datasets such as:
- [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview)
- Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification dataset

Ensure you download and place the dataset in the correct directory before training.

## Model Architecture
The project supports multiple deep learning architectures:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer learning using MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and InceptionV3
- Data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization
